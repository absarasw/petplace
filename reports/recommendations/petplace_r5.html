        <p>The year 2020 will be marked in the history books for numerous unprecedented events, many of which will change the course of history. Times have been tough, but not all events have been glum or tragic. For example, many animal shelters and rescues <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-pet-adoption-boom/">reported record high adoption rates for cats and dogs</a>, likely inspired by nationwide shelter-in-place mandates.</p>

        <p>Well, congratulations are in order for all of America’s new pet families! Perhaps you’re reading this with a new fur baby curled up beside you. We have one piece of advice that often gets forgotten amidst the excitement of adoption: Get pet insurance! Don’t wait to get started on long-term pet care, because the younger the pet, the better.</p>
        
        <h2 id="reasons-for-puppy-pet-insurance-now">3 Reasons for Puppy Pet Insurance Now</h2>
        <h3 id="lower-premiums">1. Lower Premiums</h3>
        <p>Just like human health insurance, pet insurance premiums are at their lowest when you purchase a plan for a dog under 1 year of age. That’s right, no matter what breed or size, the annual premium increases along with a dog’s age.</p>
        <p><a href="/article/general/pet-insurance/factors-consider-compare-pet-insurance-policies/">Pet insurance</a> is calculated according to breed, age, and zip code.</p>
        <h4 id="why-does-breed-matter">Why Does Breed Matter?</h4>
        <p>Some breeds have inherited diseases and conditions, so insurers prepare for issues that may come up in a dog’s lifetime. Additionally, the breed is a good gauge of a dog’s size when fully grown, and size matters when it comes to pet healthcare, since a Chihuahua wouldn’t need as much anesthesia as a Bull Mastiff.</p>
        <h4 id="what-about-zip-code">What About Zip Code?</h4>
        <p>Veterinary expenses differ by region, just like hospitals and doctors fees in rural areas differ from those in a metropolitan area. If you live in the latter, it makes sense to start pet insurance during <a href="/article/dogs/pet-care/is-pet-insurance-right-for-your-puppy/">puppyhood</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="puppy-healthcare-is-expensive">2. Puppy Healthcare Is Expensive</h3>
        <p>Just like a human baby needs regular check-ups and vaccinations, so does your fur baby. One of the first things you should do as a responsible pet owner is schedule a vet check-up and testing for parasite, heartworm, and <a href="https://www.avma.org/advocacy/state-local-issues/administration-rabies-vaccination-state-laws">rabies vaccinations</a>, which is a requirement in most states. Also, if your back-to-work plan includes doggy day care, your vet may also recommend monthly flea and tick medication and <a href="/article/dogs/pet-health/puppy-vaccinations-what-to-expect/">other puppy vaccinations</a> such as bordetella, leptospirosis, parvovirus, and kennel cough (which spreads in group settings).</p>
        <p>Then, there’s neutering or spaying to consider, which is often recommended at around 6-months for small dogs and 12-months for bigger pooches. This procedure, unless the shelter or rescue organization has already taken care of it, will definitely be costly. While your puppy goes through surgery, you may also want to consider <a href="/article/general/pet-care/microchip-pet-month/">microchipping</a>, for a greater chance of reunion in case of separation (ID tags and collars can be removed).</p>
        <p>Additionally, puppies are energetic, curious creatures and boy, can they get into trouble. How will you handle the financial impact of a <a href="/article/dogs/pet-care/dog-care/puppy-care/pup-diaries-entry-5-our-first-pup-emergency-20-24-weeks/">puppy emergency</a> for accidents like ingesting foreign objects or play-related injuries?</p>
        <p><a href="/article/general/keeping-your-pet-healthy/what-is-pet-insurance/">Pet insurance</a> will come to your rescue for accidents and illnesses, and if you add on a <a href="/article/cats/pet-insurance/what-is-a-pet-wellness-plan/">wellness plan</a>, a good portion of vaccinations, medication, testing, and neuter/spaying costs will be covered.</p>

        <h3 id="puppies-dont-have-pre-existing-conditions">3. Puppies Don’t Have Pre-Existing Conditions</h3>
        <p>Just like an adorable newborn baby, your perfect puppy is cute, peppy, healthy, eats well, plays well, sleeps well, and feels great! This is the perfect reason and time to enroll in a pet insurance plan. You see, once your pup receives any kind of diagnosis from a vet, it will be considered a <a href="/article/general/pet-insurance/pet-insurance-preexisting-conditions/">pre-existing condition</a>.</p>
        <p>Depending on the diagnosis, your premium may be higher and expenses related to the condition may be excluded from coverage, all leading to out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
        <p>Did you know, environmental <a href="/article/general/pet-care/allergy-testing-pets/">allergies</a> are considered a pre-existing condition due to their incurable nature? Common signs of allergies in dogs are itchiness and skin inflammation, and can start to show between the ages of 1 – 3 years.</p>
        <p>You already provide your puppy with love, the best food, and coolest toys. Why not invest in their health and well-being? <a href="https://www.petpartners.com/enroll?p=PP2020">Pet insurance</a> not only makes financial sense, but is a proven way to ensure that you are able to give your pet the best care when they need it the most. Here is a good introduction to <a href="/article/general/keeping-your-pet-healthy/what-is-pet-insurance/">how pet insurance works.</a></p>
