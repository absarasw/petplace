        <h2 id="how-does-a-wellness-plan-compare-to-a-pet-insurance-policy">How Does a Wellness Plan Compare to a Pet Insurance Policy?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.embracepetinsurance.com/coverage/wellness-rewards">Pet Wellness Plans</a> aren’t traditional pet insurance policies but are usually purchased as an add-on to an insurance policy. They typically provide reimbursement for eligible routine care, while regular pet insurance offers reimbursement for accidents and illnesses.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-pick-a-pet-wellness-plan">How to Pick a Pet Wellness Plan?</h2>
        <p>A quick way to start is to look for a pet insurance provider that offers a wellness plan. Consider what you normally spend on “wellness” over the course of a year and then review the cost of the wellness plan and what it covers. Review the plan options to see what works best for your budget.</p>
        <h2 id="what-does-a-pet-wellness-plan-cover">What Does a Pet Wellness Plan Cover?</h2>
        <p>Services covered by many plans include physical examinations, vaccinations, diagnostic testing, fecal exams, deworming, dental cleaning, urine testing, electrocardiograms, additional diagnostic testing and, in some cases, unlimited free office visits.</p>
        <p>Again, the covered services depend on the plan. Wellness plans include more preventive health coverage than budget plans.</p>
        <p>Similar plans are offered at veterinary hospitals, but cost and coverage will vary. This may be a good option if you live near one of these facilities.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-not-covered-with-wellness-plans">What Is Not Covered with Wellness Plans?</h2>
        <p>In general, wellness plans are intended to make wellness care more affordable and are not intended for use on “unpredictable or abnormal” occurrences, such as illnesses and injuries.</p>
        <h2 id="when-does-coverage-begin-once-you-sign-up-for-a-wellness-plan">When Does Coverage Begin Once You Sign Up for a Wellness Plan?</h2>
        <p>For most plans, coverage goes into effect as soon as the first payment is made. There is no waiting period for new plan members before services can be used.</p>
        <h2 id="is-a-pet-wellness-plan-better-for-your-wallet-in-the-long-run">Is a Pet Wellness Plan Better for Your Wallet in the Long Run?</h2>
        <p>That depends. The advantage of a pet wellness plan is that you can provide your pet with recommended preventive care to help keep them healthy. For example, if you vaccinate your pet to prevent disease and give your pet medications to prevent fleas and ticks, they will likely be healthier. So, if a wellness plan helps you ensure your pet’s health, it could help avoid future health emergencies, which will save you money.</p>
